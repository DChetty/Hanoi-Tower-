# Hanoi-Tower-
The Tower of Hanoi problem consists of 3 rods and n discs of different sizes. Roughly, the goal of the problem is to move the stack of discs from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod. However, as all problems, some rules have to be followed: We can only move one disc at a time and a bigger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
